                <h2>On the Subject of Power Button</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Shutting down…</p>

                <p>This module will present itself as a big power button. You will need to press it at the correct time.</p>

                <p>The power button can be on or off. You can tell if it’s outer ring is lit or not.</p>
                
                <p>If it is on, see list Turn it Off.
                <br>Otherwise, see list Turn it On.</p>
                
                <p><b>Turn it Off</b>
                <br>There are 3 different rules: rule A, rule B, and rule C.</p>
                
                <p><b>Rule A</b> is if there are more than two batteries and at least one lit indicator.
                <br><b>Rule B</b> is if there is a CAR indicator present and there is an RJ-45 port present.
                <br><b>Rule C</b> is if Rule A and Rule B do not apply.</p>

                <p>If rule A is true, add up the numbers in your serial number and find the digital root of that. Turn the power button off when the timer’s seconds digit reaches that number.</p>

                <p>If rule B is true, add up how many unsolved modules there are. If this number is greater than 60, subtract 20 until it is between 1 and 59. Turn the power button off when the timer’s two seconds digits reaches this number (if it’s one digit, it would be 01, 02, 03, etc.).</p>

                <p>If rule C is true, turn the power button off when the last two digits of the bomb’s timer add up to a prime number.</p>

                <p><b>Turn it On</b>
                <br>There are 2 different rules: rule D and rule E.</p>

                <p><b>Rule D</b> is if there is more than half the original time on the bomb remaining.
                <br><b>Rule E</b> is if rule D isn’t true.</p>

                <p>If rule D is true, turn it on when the number of solved modules is a multiple of 5 OR it is the last unsolved module.
                <br>If rule E is true, turn it on when the number of unsolved modules is a multiple of 5 OR it is the last unsolved module.</p>
